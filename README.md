## Feed Reader Udacity Project

To run the application, clone the repository to your computer and open the index.html file in your browser.

## Using the application

When you view the application in your browser, you will initially see a green menu bar at the top of the page with 
'Feeds' as the content, along with the Jasmine footer. This footer initially appears as the only item below the Feeds 
header section as the rest of the page's content loads asynchronously. The Jasmine section will then be moved to the 
bottom of the page and will highlight in green any tests which have been proved to pass with a true outcome and in red 
any tests which have failed and the corresponding error.
